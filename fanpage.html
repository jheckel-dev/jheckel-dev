        <h2> BIO </h2>

        <p>
            <b>Ninja Sex Party</b> (also abbreviated <b>NSP</b> is an American comedy duo consisting of singer/bassist Dan Avidan and keyboardist Brian Wecht. They formed in 2009 in New York City and are currently based in Los Angeles. 
            They are also known as two-thirds of the video game-based musical trio Starbomb, together with Arin Hanson.
            Avidan joined Hanson's YouTube Let's Play Webseries <i>Game Grumps</i> as cohost in 2013.

        </p>

        <p>
            The work of NSP consists of rock or synth-pop-oriented humorous songs, frequently the topics of sex, seduction, love or fantasy, with Avidan and Wecht respectively portraying the characters of Fanny Sexbang, and exuberant, idiotic, hypersexual Jewish man trying to hit on women and Ninja Brian, and uncommunicative, homocidal ninja.
            However, their <i>Under the Covers</i> cover album series that started in 2016 saw them take on a non-comedic approach to music for the first time, covering songs from the '70's and '80's.
        </p>

        <p>To date, NSP has released either studio albums (five original works, and three cover albums), in addition to three albums as part of Starbomb. 
            Wecht initially acted as the record producer and performed all instruments on their early albums, until they started working with producer Jim Arsenault (and later Jim Roach) and backing band Tupperware Remix in 2015.
            Wecht and Avidan have appeared in Tupper Ware Remix Party's own works, as themselves or as NSP. Since May 2018, Wecht also portrays Ninja Brian in his own live comedy show titled <i>Ninja Brian's All-Star Variety Luau Spectacular.</i>
